With this issue, *The Catholic Observer* changes name to *The Point*. It is a name we feel is wonderfully fitting. If there is any adjective that describes American life today, it is “pointless.” What are we here for? where are we going? what is the point of it all? are questions that are left unanswered. Our particular concern, though, is that Catholics are sharing in this general regime of pointlessness. And for them it is especially tragic, for they have been entrusted with keeping the one true Faith, and today they are losing sight of the point of that Faith. They treat it as an efficient organization for the suppression of Communism, as a fund-raising, enterprise — as almost everything, except what it is, the Church founded by Our Lord Jesus Christ for our salvation.

If you want to get *The Point*, send us your name and address, and we will put you on our mailing list. We can promise you a monthly [edition] of notes and comment in which all of the remarks will be pointed, pointed in the direction of the Catholic Faith.

Christmas has passed for another year, and the Infant God and His Mother were no more noticeable in this Christmas than in any of the past few. It was once again a day of Seasons Greetings, Santa Claus, department store gifts, and package-store spirits. Boston Catholics, however, were given the privilege of observing Christmas in the traditional Catholic manner. They were thoughtfully provided with Midnight Mass on television, enabling them to witness the real absence of the Real Presence in the comfort of their living rooms.

The boys and girls of Saint Benedict Center have in the past month been going around Boston selling Catherine Goddard Clarke’s new book, Gate of Heaven. In the course of doing this, they have spoken with some 70,000 Boston Catholics. Needless to say, their experiences have been many and diverse. Some of these experiences we will tell you of in future issues. But, in general, they have this to report: While there remains a large number of those unworthy Catholics who are ashamed of their faith or indifferent to it, yet there is unmistakably a new vitality among Boston Catholics — a kind of waking up — a growing concern for the state of the Faith and determination that it be not lost. These are the people who have been responsible for making Gate of Heaven the most widely read and discussed book in all of Boston.

Incidentally, *Gate of Heaven* will soon be available through bookstores, in a clothbound edition coming out March 3.

To say “regardless of race, color, or creed” is like saying “regardless of butcher, baker, or murderer.” The people who want us to disregard our creed are usually people who have no creed of their own worth regarding.

The following question appeared, so help us, in a Harvard Philosophy Exam: “7. Prove that when an irresistible force meets an immovable body, Hell freezes over. (This can be done by pure logic.)”

Which shows what you can get away with when you have ivy on your walls.

Archbishop Cushing, in a recent address: “One-half of the world today is anti-God.”

Father Keller, of the Christophers, in a recent pamphlet: “Less than one percent of the world is causing all the world’s troubles.”

Things seem to be a lot better in the New York diocese.
