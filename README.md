# The Point Journal Archive

This repository contains a digital archive of *The Point*, a journal published by Father Leonard Feeney and the religious community he founded, the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The journal was the primary vehicle for promoting Father Feeney's strict and controversial interpretation of the Catholic doctrine *Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus* ("Outside the Church there is no salvation").

## About The Journal

*The Point* was first published in the 1950s from the Saint Benedict Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its central theme was the absolute necessity of membership in the Catholic Church, through the baptism of water, for salvation. The journal aggressively challenged what it saw as liberalizing trends in the Church, particularly the understanding of "baptism of desire" and "baptism of blood." Its style is polemical, direct, and uncompromising, reflecting the heated theological debates of its time.
